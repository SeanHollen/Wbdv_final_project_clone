### State the problem you are trying to solve
People want to speak foreign languages quickly. 
Many services that teach foreign languages say that memorization does not work, and tout their alternatives. But in most languages, the most common 1000 words make up the vast majority of what people say, allowing people to fill in the blanks. The problem isn’t memorization, but that it has been done wrong. 
### Include a description of at least two types of users that would use your Web application
We could possibly support teachers as well as students. Students will be learning the language while teachers provide content and evaluate student performance.
There are also students of different skill levels. Our application should allow students of higher skill levels to quickly advance to more difficult content.  
### For each of the types of users, provide two goals the user would like to achieve with your Web application
Students have multiple goals: vocabulary, grammar, understanding, and pronunciation. 
The goal of the teachers is to correct students in the above. They will correct poor grammar, poor pronunciation, and misused vocabulary. They will also explain things the students don’t understand. To do this, we could have a voice chat system. If this is too advanced, we could have a text messaging system. 
### State the overall strategy of how you intend to solve the problem
For vocabulary, we want people to associate the sound of words with images directly. We could get recordings of the sounds of words using google translate text-to-speech, and images of the words from Google images. 
### One of the main requirements is to work with data available from some public, free, Web API. Provide a brief description of the Web API you intend to use
Google translate and Google images APIs.
